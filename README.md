# (Go) Kart

Kart is a simple speed-typing race. It is meant to be used
in demos / workshows. Kart was designed to show a few
interesting aspects of Go, particularly concurrency and interfaces.

Suggestions for experimentation and alteration, ranging from
small to large, are marked with "MORE FUN" in the code.

To run (and hack on) Kart:

* [Install Go](http://golang.org/doc/install)
* Get the code: `go get github.com/josharian/kart`
* `cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/josharian/kart`
* Run the tests: `go test ./...`
* Run go vet: `go vet ./...`
* Format the code: `gofmt -w -s .`
* Build: `go build *.go`
* Run: `./kart`
